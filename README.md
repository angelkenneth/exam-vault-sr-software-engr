## Microservices using NextJs (API only) and Vue

## Prerequisites

1. NodeJS 18 (minimum)
2. [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

## Approach

1. I decided to go with NextJs for the API
   1. Because it's the faster to setup -- but did not use its frontend features 
   2. Though I could have went with `http.createServer` -- but base on experience, there would be too much boilerplate
   3. I deemed that it was more important to focus on creating routes and business logic
2. Due to time constraints, I did use Gen AIs like GitHub Copilot
   1. But rest assured that I did not just blindly use them
   2. I understand it and it would have been the code that I would have wrote anyway
